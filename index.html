    <h1>History of the European Union</h1>
    <p>The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. Its roots can be traced back to the aftermath of World War II, with the aim of fostering economic cooperation and preventing further conflicts in the region. The idea was that countries that trade together are more likely to avoid conflicts. The European Coal and Steel Community, established in 1951 by six European countries, was the first of a series of supranational European institutions that would eventually become today's European Union.</p>
    
    <p>Over the years, the EU has grown in size through the accession of new member states and in power through the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty of 1993 established the modern-day European Union with its pillar structure, including the European Community, Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters. The Euro, introduced in 1999, has become the common currency for many EU member states. Today, the EU stands as a significant economic and political entity on the global stage.
